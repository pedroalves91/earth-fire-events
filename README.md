# Reactjs responsive app that gives infomation about active wildfires and their location on a map

This app uses Leaflet and React-leaflet instead of Google Maps, because it's a library that can be used for free even on production, without any API keys.

The information about the wildfires is fetched using the [NASA API](https://eonet.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/api/v2.1/events)


### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
